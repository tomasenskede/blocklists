# Firewall Blocklists Repository

Welcome to the **Firewall Blocklists Repository** by **Tomasenskede**!

## What Are Blocklists?
Blocklists are collections of IP addresses, domains, or URLs that are known to be associated with malicious activity, such as:
- Spam
- Malware
- Phishing
- Botnets
- Unwanted advertising

By integrating these lists into your firewall, you can proactively block traffic from or to known harmful entities, enhancing the security of your network and protecting users.

## Features
- **Regular Updates:** The blocklists are regularly maintained to ensure they stay effective against emerging threats.
- **Flexible Use:** Lists are formatted to be compatible with most firewalls.
- **Customizable:** You can adapt these lists to your specific needs by combining them with your own rules.

## How to Use
1. Import the blocklist URL(s) into your firewall's blocking rules or threat protection system.
2. Set up regular updates to ensure the blocklist stays current.
3. Monitor your logs to verify blocked traffic and fine-tune the rules if needed.

## Contribution
If you have suggestions for new lists or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer
These blocklists are provided as-is and may not cover all potential threats. Always test in a non-production environment and ensure they suit your specific network needs.
